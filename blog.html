            <h1>California Area</h1>
            <p>
              Shaped by flames, oceans, and the Tectonic Plates, the state of California has some of the most stunning instances of nature and its beauty present on planet earth. Blessed with an environmental bounty from the depths of Death Valley all the way to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada, California has never been more in need of an environmental reckoning than right now. Stretching back to the 1920s the last of the California Grizzly Bear was gunned down by humans in Fresno County. The only California Grizzly that remains in California is the one on the state flag, serving as an empty symbol of what happens when we disregard the environment. Every year progressively worsening wildfires brutalize the landscape with no end in sight. The rising ocean erodes away at the sea cliffs that once watched over the Pacific. With climate change knocking at the door, California must respond now before the consequences of neglecting the environment become inevitable. California governor, Gavin Newsom has just proposed another $22 billion in the 2022-23 budget dedicated to fixing the effects of climate change. This certainly will not be enough to eradicate climate change in California but with sustained efforts from the government and citizens alike California’s magnificent scenery can live on into a brighter day.

            <h1>Oregon Area</h1>
            <p>
              Oregon is a state on the west coast known for the vast deserts and majestic mountains. It has a unique beauty to it just waiting to be explored. Unfortunately, this paradise has been under attack by wildfires. The Forest Service in Oregon have tweeted on August 22nd, 2018, that over 23 wildfires have burned down a total of 444,000 acres of land making it unfarmable for farmers and costing over five million dollars’ worth of wheat and that was just the beginning. The most recent fire that occurred in Oregon was the Bootleg Wildfire in 2021. This beast had burned down over 413,000 acres of land in just 39 days (Oregon Live). If this path of fire continues Oregon will be known as this barren land instead of a beautiful home to wildlife and nature.

            <h1>Salmon Dying in Rivers All Over the West Coast, Why is it Happening?</h1>
            <p>This summer we have all seen the crazy heat waves that have been raging across America. Here in the Pacific Northwest they have had a serious effect on one of our most prized species, the Salmon. Even causing temperatures to surpass government regulations on environmental waters! If we don’t take action now we could be facing serious problems in the future….
