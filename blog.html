            <h1>Oregon Area</h1>
            <p>
              Oregon is a state on the west coast known for the vast deserts and majestic mountains. It has a unique beauty to it just waiting to be explored. Unfortunately, this paradise has been under attack by wildfires. The Forest Service in Oregon have tweeted on August 22nd, 2018, that over 23 wildfires have burned down a total of 444,000 acres of land making it unfarmable for farmers and costing over five million dollars’ worth of wheat and that was just the beginning. The most recent fire that occurred in Oregon was the Bootleg Wildfire in 2021. This beast had burned down over 413,000 acres of land in just 39 days (Oregon Live). If this path of fire continues Oregon will be known as this barren land instead of a beautiful home to wildlife and nature.

            <h1>Salmon Dying in Rivers All Over the West Coast, Why is it Happening?</h1>
            <p>This summer we have all seen the crazy heat waves that have been raging across America. Here in the Pacific Northwest they have had a serious effect on one of our most prized species, the Salmon. Even causing temperatures to surpass government regulations on environmental waters! If we don’t take action now we could be facing serious problems in the future….
