            <p>Hi, I am Jonathan Tang and am currently a sophomore at IHS in Issaquah Washington. I have always seen climate change as an issue that is very near and dear to me. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest the outdoors were always a big aspect of my life, and the prospect of its beauty being taken at the hands of fellow humans always made me sad. Beacause of this I created the PWC not just to express my thoughts but to be able to connect with other people that felt the same. </p>

            <h3>Founder, Writer</h3>
            <div class="bottom-line"></div>
            <p>Hi, I am Ashwin Suresh, I am currently a sophomore in Washington State. For me, climate change and environmental issues are always something I have respected on a deeper level. I spent my childhood in big cities in India and California which meant I saw the other end of the spectrum, where the environment took a backseat most of the time. Because of these experiences, I founded the PWC with Jonathan to inform others and help them truly understand some of the problems surrounding them and some things they can do to impact the world positively.
