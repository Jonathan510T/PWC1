              <p>Hi, I am Jonathan Tang and am currently a sophomore at IHS in Issaquah Washington. I have always seen climate change as an issue that is very near and dear to me. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest the outdoors were always a big aspect of my life, and the prospect of its beauty being taken at the hands of fellow humans always made me sad. Beacause of this I created the PWC not just to express my thoughts but to be able to connect with other people that felt the same. </p>

              <div class="bottom-line"></div>
              <p>Hi, I am Ashwin Suresh, I am currently a sophomore in Washington State. For me, climate change and environmental issues are always something I have respected on a deeper level. I spent my childhood in big cities in India and California which meant I saw the other end of the spectrum, where the environment took a backseat most of the time. Because of these experiences, I founded the PWC with Jonathan to inform others and help them truly understand some of the problems surrounding them and some things they can do to impact the world positively.

              <p>Hi, I am Calvin Rodrigue, I am currently a sophomore at Issaquah High School. I care deeply about the environment, and want to do everything in my power to help it. It is important to me that our planet survives and thrives, because it is the only one we have. I was born in and have grown up on the West Coast, which is why the environment here matters so much. I want to do everything in my power to help it.
